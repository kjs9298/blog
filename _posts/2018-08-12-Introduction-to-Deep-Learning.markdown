**AI** will bring about big transformation like Electricity.

**ReLU** is the most used activation function in deep learning models.
$$f(x) = max(0, x)$$

Depending data, We used Standard NN, CNN, RNN or hybrid NN architectures.

RNN used applications for sequence data like speech recognition and machine translation.
- [ ] O 
- [ ] X

A example of **structured data** is statistics about house prising by features.
- [ ] O
- [ ] X

**Unstructured data** refers to things like audio and image. (might be pixel data)
- [ ] O
- [ ] X
