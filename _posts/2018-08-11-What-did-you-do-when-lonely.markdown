I'm writing this post to practice using english.
I wanna some of subjects that It has enough thing I can talk about.
My grammar and an expression are actually not good.
Just I hope to make me more better. ðŸ˜Š

I know an application in my phone.
It give a topic in every day and many users register their thoughts.

The topic I'm gonna to say is `What do you do when you feel lonely?`

I have experiences like that before and now.
The answer is just eating a lot.
I know it is very unhealthy habits. 
However, After losing my weight I could not control my self.

The purpose eating a lot is only forgetting other thoughts.
Usually, I feel lonely when I had a problem of work or relationship.
I kept recapping that time continuously. I even had a feeling same as that time.
Of course, It make me be suffering.
I have to forget thing totally.
I don't know why it helps me forgetting that exactly. Eating became one of the mean.  
Maybe I manage my diet a little tightly, It seem to be switch that can turn off my brain.
As soon as starting eating, My brain got down and forgot all of things.
And That is why I eat a lot.
(It is not reasonable ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹ã…‹)

Nowadays, I reduced times of that bad habits.
And I keep trying to overcome it. 
Sometimes, by doing an excercise and sometimes, playing game.
(I didn't feel like playing online game before.)

I'll assume that There are many korean girls who have similar habits.
I want to cheer them and hope to overcome it with me. (with various ways)
