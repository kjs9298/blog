Umm... <br>
Before I got a job, There was only one reason. <br>
### Before : To get extra points. ###
  Though the job I wanted doesn't need English skill, I and my colleagues were having tests.<br>
More details, We had prepared tests named TOEIC, TOEIC Speaking and OPIC.<br>
No one and No companies asked us to score higher than a certain score.<br>
We made scores themselves thinking "To get a job, We should at least.".<br>
Anyway I got scores that I hope, but was I good at English ? I did't think so. ðŸ˜“

### Now : I don't want any limits to work. ###
**1. Choose my work.**<br>
  I had international company interview a year ago. (have to work in abroad branch.)<br>
I got great review with my algorithm test but I failed to pass it because of my English skill.<br>
I couldn't express What I think, How I can solve this problem in English well.<br>
Of course, I am satisfied with my work now. But It's a shame I couldn't answer them.

**2. Learn things I don't know**<br>
  When I am working, I have to find references or posts about technology.<br>
You know, There is tremendous difference between them in English and in Korean.<br>
Most of references of library are written in English. There are translations, But sometimes make me misunderstand.<br>
In addition, It is hard to find data in Korean. I have to spend a lot of times to do it.<br>
It doesn't matter if the topic is so popular or used a lot.<br>
If they are new technologies, It will be harder.<br>
(Rather than finding them, I would rather study English and read the original. ðŸ˜‚)

I'll work with exciting thing in wide world. <br>
I would like to make my dreams come true. ðŸ•º
