Umm... <br>
Before I got a job, There was only one reason. <br>
### Before : To get extra points. ###
  Though the job I wanted doesn't need English skill, I and my colleagues were having tests.
More details, We had prepared tests named TOEIC, TOEIC Speaking and OPIC.
No one and No companies asked us to score higher than a certain score.
We made scores themselves thinking "To get a job, We should at least.".
Anyway I got scores that I hope, but was I good at English ? I did't think so. ðŸ˜“

### Now : I don't want any limits to work. ###
**1. Choose my work.**<br>
  I had international company interview a year ago. (have to work in abroad branch.)
I got great review with my algorithm test but I failed to pass it because of my English skill.
I couldn't express What I think, How I can solve this problem in English well.
Of course, I am satisfied with my work now. But It's a shame I couldn't answer them.

**2. Learn things I don't know**<br>
  When I am working, I have to find references or posts about technology.
You know, There is tremendous difference between them in English and in Korean.
Most of references of library are written in English. There are translations, But sometimes make me misunderstand.
In addition, It is hard to find data in Korean. I have to spend a lot of times to do it.
It doesn't matter if the topic is so popular or used a lot.
If they are new technologies, It will be harder.
(Rather than finding them, I would rather study English and read the original. ðŸ˜‚)

I'll work with exciting thing in wide world. 
I would like to make my dreams come true. ðŸ•º
