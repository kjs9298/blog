With my boy friend ! I have been dating for 3 years.
You know, It is really hot days.
In summer, We have cool plan for our date.

That is staying in cafe.
Of course, The reason is not a cup of nice coffee but an `air conditioner`.
There are always many couples like us.
We order 2 cup of coffee and sometimes a honey bread (with whipping cream).
We spend most of times to study each other.
Mostly, He is listening online lectures about deep learning.
I'm making a web program or studying english.

We have a good time better than before recently.
It is that we have common points we are studying.
He started making a web program using python, and I attended study group for Machine learning.
We can ask some issues that have difficulty of understanding to each other and answer it.
I think we are comfortable helpers. 

Anyway, I think last of story has nothing to do with today's topic. (Sorry ðŸ˜‚)

**Being cooped up in cool place** is the best way to survive in summer.
I'm going to do it until end of August. ðŸ˜†
