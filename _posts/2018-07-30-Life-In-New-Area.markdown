I moved here in October last year. So It's been about 10 months now.
I've been pretty happy with everything for the most part.
One of the best thing is distance to my work.
There is clean and fast metro near my home. If I take it, I can arrive to destination for only 10 minutes.
Also, The area have a extremely long stream to walk with my friend. 
We used to take a stroll chatting about many different kins of news.
I want to tell you a lot of great restaurants.
I found some places that tastes good, is cheap and a large quantities. and I've been trying to find them more and more.
 
Anyway, I do wish there were cheap houses I could live in.
That's what you get for living close from the city with many companies, right?
